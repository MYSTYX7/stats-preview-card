## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Responsive

### What I learned

Using CSS Flexbox and responsive design.

```css
body{
  background-color: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
### Continued development

Will try to make it responsive for each screen size in future.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp) - This helped me making flexbox responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
